**Manzano**
=======================


* The [**Manzano Wiki**](https://github.com/usgs/asl-manzano/wiki) includes installation, usage and developer details.
* The MAN page (green_manzano.1) includes basic green manzano usage.
* The doxyfile (Doxyfile) can be used to generate code automatic documentation.

### Manzano is a library to communicate with hardware used in seismological stations. Currently:

 + [Q330 Digitizer](http://www.kinemetrics.com/uploads/PDFs/q330.pdf)
 + [E300 STS1 sensor electronics](http://www.metrozet.com/legacy/STS1-E300_Manual_V1_20.pdf)
 + [Falcon facilities monitoring system](http://rletech.com/our-products/facility-monitoring-systems/server-room-facility-monitoring/fms/)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Key components:
 + Custom serialization library, that allows for unusual data types such as a 24 bit integers and others.
 + Custom auto-generation process for bitmap data structures with a common internal representation.
 + Udp, Tcp and Serial connections. Serial connections uses William Woodall [C++ serial library](https://github.com/wjwwood/serial)
 + Common addressing mechanism for a network of different devices (inclucing multiple stations).
 + Common instruction set for easy use of devices. For example, for the Q330 digitizer:

## Manzano Applications

### Green Manzano 
Command line tool to use Manzano either interactively or with a script.

### Yellow Manzano 
Interacts with an [E300](http://www.metrozet.com/legacy/STS1-E300_Manual_V1_20.pdf). Intended to run on a station's data_processor or another linux device connected serially with the E300, links the E300 with an udp server for remote interaction.

### Red Manzano (under development)
GUI (Qt) tool to use Manzano interactively.

### Falcon
Application to read data from a falcon web service, extract contiguous packets of information and serialize/send packets to external servers.
